# AccessibilityMentor

Mainly, AccessibilityMentor helps newcomers as well as more experienced accessibility advocates become better in their field. But actually it is much more. By contributing to the Open Source project, you will gain hands-on experience working in an agile team, improve your skills and be part of an awesome community.

‼️ To get more women and especially people with disabilities into tech, I always assign tickets to them first.

### CodeNewbies

If you are a complete beginner in open source / GitHub, don't worry. Look at the following description on [how to set up the project locally](https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/dev-cv/blob/main/README.md#how-to-contribute).

If you are a complete beginner in coding or open source, don't worry. Let's start with the following:

You can find everything needed to fulfill this issue by looking the terms up in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). If these sites are new to you, don't worry. You will get used to them over time.
Happy coding 🙂
