# ‚ùó AccessibilityMentor is taking a break ‚ùó

Thank you so much for your contributions ü•≥.

For now, this project does not take any new PRs, issue suggestions and such. After refactoring and updating the code base of the repository by the maintainers, the repo will be back with more issues and even better guidance.

See you soon üëã

If you are a complete beginner in coding or open source, don't worry. Let's start with the following:

You can find everything needed to fulfill this issue by looking the terms up in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). If these sites are new to you, don't worry. You will get used to them over time.
Happy coding üôÇ
